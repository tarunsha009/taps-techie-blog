If you've been working with Python for a while, you've probably used Enums for simple constants. But did you know that Python Enums can carry custom data and behave like mini data classes? Let me show you a powerful pattern that will change how you think about Enums.

## The Traditional Approach: Simple Enums

Most developers start with basic Enums like this:

```python
from enum import Enum

class Status(Enum):
    ACTIVE = "active"
    INACTIVE = "inactive"
    PENDING = "pending"
```

This works fine for simple cases, but what if each status needs additional information? You might end up with separate dictionaries or multiple Enums:

```python
# The messy approach
class Status(Enum):
    ACTIVE = "active"
    INACTIVE = "inactive"
    PENDING = "pending"

# Separate mapping - yuck!
STATUS_COLORS = {
    Status.ACTIVE: "green",
    Status.INACTIVE: "red",
    Status.PENDING: "yellow"
}

STATUS_MESSAGES = {
    Status.ACTIVE: "Everything is running smoothly",
    Status.INACTIVE: "Service is currently down",
    Status.PENDING: "Waiting for approval"
}
```

This approach scatters related data across multiple places, making it harder to maintain and error-prone.

## The Game Changer: Enums with Custom Data

Here's where Python's flexibility shines. You can create Enums that carry multiple pieces of related data:

```python
from enum import Enum

class MemberType(Enum):
    STUDENT = (5, 14)  # (max_books, loan_days)
    FACULTY = (10, 30)
    GENERAL = (3, 7)

    def __init__(self, max_books: int, loan_days: int):
        self.max_books = max_books
        self.loan_days = loan_days
```

Now each enum member carries its own data! Let's see how this works:

```python
# Usage examples
member = MemberType.STUDENT
print(f"Students can borrow {member.max_books} books for {member.loan_days} days")
# Output: Students can borrow 5 books for 14 days

# You can still compare enums normally
if member == MemberType.STUDENT:
    print("Special student discount applies!")
```

## Real-World Examples Where This Shines

### 1\. HTTP Status Codes with Metadata

```python
class HTTPStatus(Enum):
    OK = (200, "Success", "Request completed successfully")
    NOT_FOUND = (404, "Not Found", "The requested resource was not found")
    SERVER_ERROR = (500, "Internal Server Error", "An unexpected error occurred")
    
    def __init__(self, code: int, message: str, description: str):
        self.code = code
        self.message = message
        self.description = description
        
    def is_error(self):
        return self.code >= 400

# Usage
status = HTTPStatus.NOT_FOUND
print(f"Status: {status.code} - {status.message}")
if status.is_error():
    print(f"Error details: {status.description}")
```

### 2\. Database Configuration Per Environment

```python
class Environment(Enum):
    DEVELOPMENT = ("localhost", 5432, "dev_db", True)
    STAGING = ("staging-server", 5432, "stage_db", True)
    PRODUCTION = ("prod-server", 5432, "prod_db", False)
    
    def __init__(self, host: str, port: int, database: str, debug: bool):
        self.host = host
        self.port = port
        self.database = database
        self.debug = debug
        
    def get_connection_string(self):
        return f"postgresql://{self.host}:{self.port}/{self.database}"

# Usage
env = Environment.PRODUCTION
connection = env.get_connection_string()
if env.debug:
    print(f"Connecting to: {connection}")
```

### 3\. Game Character Classes

```python
class CharacterClass(Enum):
    WARRIOR = (100, 20, 5, "Sword")
    MAGE = (60, 5, 25, "Staff")
    ARCHER = (80, 15, 15, "Bow")
    
    def __init__(self, health: int, strength: int, magic: int, weapon: str):
        self.health = health
        self.strength = strength
        self.magic = magic
        self.weapon = weapon
        
    def get_damage(self):
        return self.strength + (self.magic * 0.5)

# Usage
player_class = CharacterClass.MAGE
print(f"Your {player_class.name.lower()} has {player_class.health} HP")
print(f"Weapon: {player_class.weapon}")
print(f"Base damage: {player_class.get_damage()}")
```

## When Should You Use This Pattern?

This pattern is perfect when you have:

1. **Related Constants**: Multiple pieces of data that belong together
    
2. **Finite Set**: A limited number of well-defined options
    
3. **Behavior**: Each enum member might need methods or computed properties
    
4. **Type Safety**: You want to prevent invalid combinations of values
    

### Good Use Cases:

* Configuration settings for different environments
    
* User roles with permissions and limits
    
* File formats with extensions and MIME types
    
* Payment methods with processing fees and limits
    
* API endpoints with methods and authentication requirements
    

### Avoid When:

* You just need simple string constants
    
* The data changes frequently
    
* You have too many enum members (consider a class instead)
    
* The data structure is complex (nested objects, lists)
    

## Adding Methods and Properties

You can make your Enums even more powerful by adding methods. Here's a simple coffee shop example:

```python
class CoffeeSize(Enum):
    SMALL = (8, 2.50, 150)   # (ounces, price, calories)
    MEDIUM = (12, 3.25, 200)
    LARGE = (16, 4.00, 250)
    EXTRA_LARGE = (20, 4.75, 300)
    
    def __init__(self, ounces: int, price: float, calories: int):
        self.ounces = ounces
        self.price = price
        self.calories = calories
        
    @property
    def price_per_ounce(self):
        """Calculate how much you pay per ounce"""
        return self.price / self.ounces
    
    def total_cost(self, quantity: int = 1):
        """Calculate total cost for multiple cups"""
        return self.price * quantity
    
    def is_good_value(self):
        """Check if this size offers better value than small"""
        small_value = CoffeeSize.SMALL.price_per_ounce
        return self.price_per_ounce <= small_value

# Usage
my_order = CoffeeSize.LARGE
print(f"Large coffee: {my_order.ounces}oz for ${my_order.price}")
print(f"Price per ounce: ${my_order.price_per_ounce:.2f}")
print(f"Cost for 3 cups: ${my_order.total_cost(3)}")
print(f"Good value? {my_order.is_good_value()}")

# Compare all sizes
print("\nValue comparison:")
for size in CoffeeSize:
    value_indicator = "✓ Good value" if size.is_good_value() else "✗ Expensive"
    print(f"{size.name}: ${size.price_per_ounce:.2f}/oz - {value_indicator}")
```

## Inheritance and Advanced Patterns

You can even create base Enum classes for common patterns:

```python
from enum import Enum
from abc import abstractmethod

class ConfigurableEnum(Enum):
    """Base class for enums with configuration data"""
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_config(self):
        pass

class DatabaseType(ConfigurableEnum):
    MYSQL = ("mysql", 3306, "mysql+pymysql")
    POSTGRESQL = ("postgresql", 5432, "postgresql+psycopg2")
    SQLITE = ("sqlite", None, "sqlite")
    
    def __init__(self, name: str, default_port: int, driver: str):
        self.db_name = name
        self.default_port = default_port
        self.driver = driver
    
    def get_config(self):
        return {
            'driver': self.driver,
            'port': self.default_port,
            'name': self.db_name
        }
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep It Simple**: Don't overload Enums with too much complexity
    
2. **Immutable Data**: Enum values should not change after creation
    
3. **Meaningful Names**: Use descriptive names for both the enum and its data
    
4. **Document Parameters**: Make it clear what each parameter represents
    
5. **Type Hints**: Always use type hints in your `__init__` method
    

## Conclusion

Python Enums with custom data are a powerful tool for creating clean, maintainable code. They help you group related constants and behavior together, making your code more organized and less error-prone.

The next time you find yourself creating multiple dictionaries or constants for related data, consider using this pattern instead. Your future self (and your teammates) will thank you for the cleaner, more maintainable code.

Remember: the goal is not to use this pattern everywhere, but to recognize when it's the right tool for the job. Start simple, and add complexity only when it provides clear value.
